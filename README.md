# Link-Machine-Number
A tool that will go through an excel sheet and link the top bill of materials to the top BOM docs

This is a VBA macro code for Excel. When you run the macro it will go down the "B" column and search through the server for any file with the same number and hyperlink the part number to that file. 
If it does not find the file it will not hyperlink it.

Note that this application only looks for .DOCX files and not PDFs.

To import a macro into Excel, you can do the following: 
  1. Open the workbook you want to import the macro to, or create a new workbook. 
  2. Open the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) by pressing Alt + F11 on your keyboard. 
  3. In the Project Explorer window, right-click the workbook name and select Import File. 
  4. Browse to the folder and file that contains the macro code and click Open. This will add the module with the macro code to the workbook.
