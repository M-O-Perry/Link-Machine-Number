# Link-Machine-Number
A tool that will go through an excel sheet and link the top bill of materials to the top BOM docs

This is a VBA macro code for Excel. When you run the macro it will go down the "B" column and search through the server for any file with the same number and hyperlink the part number to that file. 
If it does not find the file it will not hyperlink it.

Note that this application only looks for .DOCX files and not PDFs.
